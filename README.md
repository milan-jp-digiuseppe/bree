This is a react native app with Expo created by following:

1. https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
2. https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=ios&device=simulated

I developed and tested this app only on iOS for the sake of time and and ease of dev environment setup. I tested this on a simulator and my physical iPhone. I followed this setup guide (https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=ios&device=simulated#set-up-xcode) to develop, build, and run the app. Download the Expo Go app from the App Store to test on a physical iPhone

Run `npm start` to start the development server, then type `i` to open an iOS simulator
